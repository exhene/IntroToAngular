# TestingAngular

Angular is an open-source, front-end web development framework developed by Google. It is used for building dynamic, single-page web applications and has gained popularity due to its robustness, flexibility, and ability to create complex web applications with ease. Angular is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and utilizes TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, as its primary language. With Angular, developers can create reusable UI components, simplify data binding and dependency injection, and leverage built-in tools for testing and debugging. Additionally, Angular has a large and active community of developers, making it easy to find support, resources, and third-party libraries to enhance development.
